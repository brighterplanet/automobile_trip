### Automobile impact model
# This model is used by [Brighter Planet](http://brighterplanet.com)'s [CM1 web service](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com) to calculate the impacts of an automobile trip, such as energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.

##### Timeframe
# The model calculates impacts that occured during a particular time period (`timeframe`).
# For example if the `timeframe` is February 2010, an automobile put into use (`acquisition`) in December 2009 and taken out of use (`retirement`) in March 2010 will have impacts because it was in use during January 2010.
# An automobile put into use in March 2010 or taken out of use in January 2010 will have zero impacts, because it was not in use during February 2010.
#
# The default `timeframe` is the current calendar year.

##### Calculations
# The final impacts are the result of the calculations below. These are performed in reverse order, starting with the last calculation listed and finishing with the greenhouse gas emissions calculation.
#
# Each calculation listing shows:
#
# * **value returned** (***units of measurement***)
# * a description of the value
# * calculation methods, listed from most to least preferred
#
# Some methods need `values` returned by prior calculations. If any of these `values` are unknown the method is skipped.
# If all of the methods for a calculation are skipped, the value the calculation would return is unknown.

##### Standard compliance
# When compliance with a particular standard is requested, all methods that do not comply with that standard are ignored.
# Thus any `values` a method needs will have been calculated using a compliant method or will be unknown.
# To see which standards a method complies with, look at the `:complies =>` section of the code in the right column.
# Client input complies with all standards.

##### Collaboration
# Contributions to this carbon model are actively encouraged and warmly welcomed. This library includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure that your changes do not cause regressions. All changes should include test coverage for new functionality. Please see [sniff](https://github.com/brighterplanet/sniff#readme), our emitter testing framework, for more information.
